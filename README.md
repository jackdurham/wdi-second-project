# WDI-Second-Project

## Challenges Faced

During the week of this project one of the major challenges I faced was implementing comments into into the games show page, matching up the user.id to be able to delete a comment also took some time for me to do.

## What I Liked About This Project

My favourite things about this project were that a chose a subject that I feel comfortable talking about and I'm also proud of the styling for this project.

## For The Future

Moving forward in the future for this project, I would like to add a users profile page to be able to view what reviews a single user has left.
